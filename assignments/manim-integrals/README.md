# 📘 Assignment: Visualizing Integrals with Manim

## 🎯 Objective

Learn to visualize definite integrals using the Manim library, inspired by 3Blue1Brown's style. Students will animate the area under a curve and gain intuition for what an integral represents.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️  Setup Manim and Project

#### Description
Install Manim and set up a basic animation script. Run a simple example to ensure your environment works.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Install Manim (see https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/)
- Create a Python script that runs a basic Manim scene
- Render a simple animation (e.g., a moving square or circle)


### 🛠️  Visualize the Area Under a Curve

#### Description
Create a Manim animation that shows the area under the curve $y = x^2$ from $x=0$ to $x=2$. Animate the region being filled and display the value of the integral.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Plot the function $y = x^2$ on a set of axes
- Shade the area under the curve from $x=0$ to $x=2$
- Animate the filling of the area
- Display the computed value of the integral on screen


### 🛠️  (Optional) Explore with Other Functions

#### Description
Try visualizing the area under a different function of your choice (e.g., $\sin(x)$, $e^x$, etc.) and compare the results.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Plot a different function and shade the area under the curve
- Animate the filling and display the new integral value
- Briefly describe your observations in comments or a short markdown cell
